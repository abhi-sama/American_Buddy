# American_Buddy
Every year, millions of students from all around the world come to
the USA for higher education. They must adjust to a completely
different and diverse cultural life. Among the many adversities they
face, one of the top problems is the Imperial System of
measurement (Pounds,Ounce,Miles, Fahrenheit), which is used in the
USA, Liberia, and Myanmar. The rest of the world follows the Metric
System for measurement (Kilogram, Litre, Kilometre, Celsius).
Students struggle with this issue in all aspects of their daily lives,
from mundane activities such as checking the weather app, buying
milk, currency conversion and measuring distances, to more complex
tasks such as setting the thermostat in their house. It is difficult for
them to understand the units and get a sense of measurement.

o The App will help the students in following ways:-
i) It provides live weather updates in both Fahrenheit and Celsius
simultaneously. This helps create a one-to-one mapping in the
mind between both scales, which aids in developing a sense of
measurement.
ii) While traveling by car, the app displays the current speed in
both miles per hour and kilometers per hour simultaneously,
using the accelerometer and GPS location.(To Be Implemented in Future)
iii)It includes converters for Fahrenheit to Celsius, miles to
kilometers, ounces to litres, and pounds to kilograms.
iv)It provides a Database list of American Slangs.
